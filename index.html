    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
    <p>
        ELA educator and instructional technologist with over 25 years of experience across secondary and 
        post-secondary settings, including more than a decade in large urban districts serving Title I 
        and ESL-majority populations. My work integrates curriculum design, instructional technology, 
        and clear, assessment-aligned materials that support diverse learners.
    </p>
    <p>
        I design TEKS-aligned lessons, Demonstrations of Learning (DOLs), differentiated tasks, 
        and scaffolded reading/writing materials, while contributing to campus-wide efforts to 
        improve student outcomes. My instructional technology background includes LMS development, 
        online learning design, SCORM content, and work on CLEO, Texas A&M’s open-source synchronous 
        and asynchronous tutoring platform. I stay current with emerging AI tools—including LLMs, 
        retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), local models, and agentic workflows—and understand the 
        importance of using these responsibly within FERPA-aligned educational environments.
