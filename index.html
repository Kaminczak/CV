    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
    <p>
        ELA educator and instructional technologist with over 25 years of experience in secondary and 
        post-secondary learning environments, including more than a decade in large urban, Title I, and 
        ESL-majority districts. My work centers on implementing district-provided curriculum with precision, 
        clarity, and accessibility while supporting students’ reading, writing, and analytical skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        I specialize in internalizing district lessons (including LO/KO, DOLs, instructional notes, and 
        provided slide decks) and adapting them for classroom needs. This includes refining templated or 
        AI-generated questions, adjusting scaffolds, and translating complex academic language into 
        teachable steps without altering district objectives. My background in instructional technology 
        spans LMS design, SCORM development, digital writing tools, and contributions to CLEO, Texas A&M’s 
        open-source synchronous and asynchronous tutoring platform. I maintain familiarity with modern AI 
        models, RAG workflows, and FERPA-aligned use of emerging tools in instructional settings.
    </p>

        <li>Refine and adapt lesson materials by translating templated or AI-generated questions into clear,
