can you revise this to make sure the formatting is consistent and everything looks even? also let me know if you have any suggestions. I am attaching the job i am applying for . the copy chatgpt made is at https://sk.md but I felt the ai make the professional summary too on the nose with the job i am applying for. i am a teacher and never called myself instructional technologist. If you think that version is appropriate let me know.


Assessed resume formatting and compared ChatGPT version against job posting.


Remembering...

Let me grab that ChatGPT version first so I can compare both.

Got it. Now I can compare both versions against the job posting.

Your instinct is correct. The ChatGPT version calling you an "instructional technologist" is a stretch — you're a teacher who uses technology effectively, not someone with that job title. It comes across as resume-stuffing for keywords, and hiring managers in curriculum departments can smell that.

Here's my honest take:

The Real Challenge This job wants someone to create curriculum (slides, DOLs, activities, differentiated assignments). Your resume is framed around implementing curriculum. That's the gap you need to bridge — and adding a label you've never used won't do it.

What You Actually Have That Fits:

10 years at Texas Review Press (editing/publishing = creating teacher-facing materials)
CLEO development committee (workflow design, pedagogical alignment)
Writing center training (you created tutor prep courses)
You've lived the NES model on the receiving end — you know what teachers actually need from curriculum materials
HISD AI Cohort + deep knowledge of how AI-generated content needs translation for instruction
My Suggestion: Keep the professional summary honest but reframe it toward what you can bring to curriculum design, not just implementation. Something like:

"ELA educator with over 25 years of experience across secondary, post-secondary, and editorial settings. Over a decade in Title I and ESL-majority classrooms implementing NES-aligned curriculum — refining materials, adjusting scaffolds, and translating complex tasks into accessible instruction. Background includes 10 years in academic publishing, development of tutor-training curriculum, and contributions to CLEO, Texas A&M's tutoring platform. Familiar with modern AI models and FERPA-aligned instructional applications."

This positions you as someone who knows both sides: what curriculum materials look like when they hit the classroom, and how to produce quality educational content.

Want me to create a clean, reformatted version with consistent styling and this adjusted framing? I can output it as a Word doc you can use.

you should have access to https://github.com/Kaminczak/CV and if you change it up for me I can copy that into typora

What I changed:

Professional Summary — Dropped "instructional technologist," reframed to emphasize your editorial background (10 years at Texas Review Press) and curriculum development work (CLEO, tutor-training courses) alongside implementation experience. Honest but positions you for the curriculum design role.
Formatting consistency — All job titles are now bold, locations/dates on their own line, consistent spacing throughout, proper em-dashes, horizontal rules between sections.
Kept everything else intact — Your bullet points, experience, skills, and certifications all read well and don't need padding.
Copy that into Typora and you should get a clean render. If you want me to tweak anything before you push to GitHub, just say.
